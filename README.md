# LofiBlockRunner Final Technical Report

## Summary:

LofiBlockRunner was initially developed based on a [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6) tutorial on youtube, and was submitted as an entry for a selection process, the process offered a vacancy to be part of the VR lab at UVV, although I didn't get the position, I continued developing the game and later releasing it on Itch.io (V1.0.0), from time to time I come back and redo this project to compare my evolution in game development, the game is currently on version 2.0.0.
