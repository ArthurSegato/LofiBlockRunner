## Summary:
LofiBlockRunner is an endless runner where a block has to avoid obstacles while lofi music plays in the background. It was initially developed based on a [Brackeys tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6), and was submitted as an application for an internship at UVV's virtual reality lab. Although I didn't get the position, I continued to develop the game and later published it on Itch.io (v1.0.0), but regurlarly I come back to this project and redo everything from scratch to compare my evolution in game development.
